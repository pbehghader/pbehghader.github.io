                            FieryEye is a novel automated framework for debugging web sites that is based 
                            on image processing and probabilistic techniques. FieryEye first builds a model
                            that links observable changes in the websiteâ€™s appearance to faulty elements 
                            and styling properties. Then using this model, our approach predicts the elements and styling
                            properties most likely to cause the observed failure for the page
                            under test and reports these to the developer

                            RBPT
                        </h3>
                            Restricted Broadcast Process Theory (RBPT) was introduced for formal modeling and verification of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) in an algebraic way. In this project, a tool that checks the static semantics of a given specification was developed. Furthermore, it linearizes the algebraic specifications using the sound axioms of RBPT.
