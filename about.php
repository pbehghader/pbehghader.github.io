                        I was born on June 29th, 1990 in Tehran, Iran. I gained acceptance into Allame-Helli (NODET) for both middle school and high school through a nationwide exam. In the midst of my high school years, I also participated in many projects in computer group. I found out that I’m really interested in computer science and related majors.

                        After being ranked 504th in the nationwide university entrance exam, I chose Computer Engineering as my major at University of Tehran. The university is the oldest and most prestigious university in Iran. I have a GPA of 18.69 out of 20 so far, ranking me as the first student among 90 students in our class.  I obtained many full marks and top grades in the last six semesters, which makes an impressive GPA of 19.15/20.00 for that period of time. It is uncommon in our department for such achievements. I was awarded the third place for the Iran National University Students' Olympiad in Computer Engineering in June 2012. It was a great accomplishment considering that I was a junior and the contest was mainly designated for senior students. I also voluntary organized two big student communities for two years in our university. It has taught me how to work in a group and solve problems. Furthermore, I participated in two ACM ICPC regional contests as a member of University of Tehran’s team. I experienced a three months research as an international student at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) with a complete financial support. I also worked as a research assistant for two professors in Iran. All of these experiences have helped me to better understand my interests and abilities toward my career.

                        I will graduate in June 2013 and I’m looking forward to an opportunity to continue my graduate studies. I believe that learning is the best way to understand this amazing world. I want to continue my studies to become a more effective person in society. I’ve been always a very good student but I believe that if somebody wants to have a complete personality, it is necessary to consider other aspects of life like family, nature, entertainment, and philosophy of life.
