                        <b>Childhood and Teenage Hood!</b>
                        I was born in the summer of 1990 in Tehran, Iran. I spend most of my childhood playing soccer in the beautiful neighborhood of Jolfa in my hometown. In the Spring of 2001, I got accepted into the most competitive middle school of Iran (Allameh-Helli Tehran) through a nationwide exam with an acceptance rate of 0.5%. In the Spring of 2004, I started one the happiest eras of my life getting accepted into the Allameh-Helli high school. During the seven years of studying in Allameh-Helli, I participated in many student activities, and I developed a strong foundation in Mathematics and Computer Science.

                        <b> Undergraduate Studies </b>
                        I had the privilege to further broaden my knowledge in Computer Science and Engineering when I was ranked among the top 0.1% in the nationwide entrance exam to college, in 2008. I got accepted to the most prestigious university in engineering, University of Tehran in Iran and studied amongst the most talented students. I graduated from University of Tehran with a GPA of 18.42 out of 20.00 with high recognition from my professors. This accomplishment secured me the first rank in the computer engineering and IT department.
                        During my undergraduate studies I worked as a research assistant in three different areas: First, I participated in a multidisciplinary project defined in Mechanical Engineering department under the supervision of Prof. M. Raisee for one year. My role as an R.A. was to develop numerical solvers using an open source software package named OpenFoam. It was an outstanding experience as I learned how to contribute to other fields by bringing my knowledge in computer science. My second research opportunity was a three-month internship abroad as an international student at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). I was working on a new compiler to generate new Domain Specific Languages under the supervision of Prof. C. Petitpierre. I dedicated all of my efforts and completed my assigned job within a month while the project was foreseen to finish in three months. That gave me the privilege to work on other projects and to obtain a better understanding of the cutting-edge research in my desired field. In addition, I also developed a formal framework for specification and verification of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks by translating the specification to Haskel. This project, which was considered to be my undergraduate thesis, required a combination of skills on Programming Languages, Formal Methods, and Networks.
                        Furthermore, my distinctive performance in my classes led me to serve as a teaching assistant in multiple courses related to my research interests such as “Advanced Programming”, “Programming Languages”, “Software Engineering”, “System Analysis and Design”, and “Design and Analysis of Algorithms”.
                        My exceptional efforts in my undergraduate studies resulted in many awards. I was awarded the third place for Iran National University Students Olympiad in Computer Engineering in June 2011. It was a great accomplishment considering that I was a junior while the contest was mainly designed for senior students. I was also nominated for an M.S. and Ph.D. scholarship award by Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology and I became a Member of Iran's National Elites Foundation receiving considerable financial aids. In summer 2012, I was accepted in a very competitive summer internship program at EPFL with full scholarship. I was awarded as the winner of the Faculty of Engineering (FOE) by University of Tehran given to the top 1st students. Furthermore, I participated in two ACM ICPC regional contests as a member of University of Tehran’s team. Also, I was nominated as the first member of our university’s Olympiad team for the second consequent years.
                        In addition to my academic accomplishments, I participated in different student activities. I was elected as the organizer of ECE College Representatives Community. Also, I was elected as the organizer of the ACM student chapter. During these years, I dedicated many hours to lead these student communities and I built strong teamwork and communication skills through these activities.

                    <b> Graduate Studies </b>
                    In the Spring of 2013, I got admitted into the PhD programs of 7 world class leading universities with fellowships and scholarships, directly from undergraduate studies. I decided to join Software Architecture Group at the University of Southern California, to pursue my PhD under the supervision professor Nenad Medvidovic. From the earliest days of starting my PhD, in addition to pursuing my Master's degree requirements, I actively got involved into different research projects.  The first project I was involved was Extending and improving ARCADE, a software workbench that employs a suite of architecture-recovery techniques and metrics for different aspects of architectural change. I also developed a toolset to use cloud computing in order to semi-automatically run large-scale software architecture recovery analyses on the history of systems in software repositories. A part of my research was published in “An Empirical Study of Architectural Change in Open-Source Software Systems” in MSR 2015. I also improved Mahjong, a distributed software system that uses idle cycles on remote but networked computers to solve NP-complete problems. In the summer of 2015, I will be a visiting researcher at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and I will work on the supervision of Harald Gall.
