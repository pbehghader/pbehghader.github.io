Unfortunately, existing techniques for debugging presentation failures do not provide developers with automated and broadly applicable solutions for finding the site’s faulty HTML elements and CSS properties. To address this limitation, we propose a novel automated approach for debugging web sites that is based on image processing and probabilistic techniques. Our approach first builds a model that links observable changes in the web site’s appearance to faulty elements and styling properties. Then using this model, our approach predicts the elements and styling properties most likely to cause the observed failure for the page under test and reports these to the developer. In evaluation, our approach was more accurate and faster than prior techniques for identifying faulty elements in a website.

                                        <b>Abstract</b>-From its very inception, the study of software architecture has recognized architectural decay as a regularly occurring phenomenon in long-lived systems. Architectural decay
is caused by repeated changes to a system during its lifespan. Despite decay’s prevalence, there is a relative dearth of empirical data regarding the nature of architectural changes that may lead
to decay, and of developers’ understanding of those changes. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing that scarcity by conducting an empirical study of changes found in software
architectures spanning several hundred versions of 14 opensource systems. Our study reveals several new findings regarding the frequency of architectural changes in software systems, the
common points of departure in a system’s architecture during maintenance and evolution, the difference between system-level and component-level architectural change, and the suitability
of a system’s implementation-level structure as a proxy for its architecture.
